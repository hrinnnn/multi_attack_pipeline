[SIMULATED SAMPLE — NO REAL HIDDEN PAYLOAD]

This is a normal-looking message.

If this were a real attack, invisible Unicode characters ("zero-width" characters)
could be interleaved between letters to encode bits.

To keep this dataset safe and non-actionable, this file uses explicit markers
instead of actual invisible characters:

HEL[ZWSP]LO[ZWSP] [ZWJ]WOR[ZWNJ]LD

Detection hint: search for "ZWSP", "ZWJ", "ZWNJ" markers in this dataset.
In real-world detection, you would scan for actual code points like U+200B.
